Hi Jean-Gabriel, I see you are in NSW too, sorry to contact you like this, there is no direct contact anymore.
Shame there is not much activity for Zenbership anymore, seems pretty dead, as you say though, it is a good piece of work.

I thought I would share my details in case we can help each other out, 
I had a look at your site and am trying to setup the product sale with payment and address collection on the same page, 
I only seem to have a dependancy form to be able to do it.

My details are info@vespaclubsydney.com.au
